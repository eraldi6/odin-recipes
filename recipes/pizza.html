        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). If you're using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
            <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a border for the crust. Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over the sauce, followed by the Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Arrange the pepperoni, olives, bell peppers, and red onions over the cheese. Sprinkle the oregano and basil on top.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the pizza. If you're using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven. If you're using a baking sheet, place the sheet in the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
            </ol>
